## Introduction

---
The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.
With Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn’t exist.
